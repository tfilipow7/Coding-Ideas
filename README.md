# Coding-Ideas
Your first list of ideas for coding projects. Perhaps some of the projects as well. 


BUILD A WEBPAGE

"FamilyTogether"
A place where you can coordinate with your family. A combination of facebook, dropbox, and calendar. 
Share Photos
Vacation Section --> To share ideas for Vacations
Activities Section --> To share ideas for things to do together. 
Calendar of Events --> Perhaps import google here. 
Easy Mode --> For the grandparents and with a tutorial. 
Admin Mode --> Could be good for a computer savvy person to use it, but changes must be made as a group to prevent sabatoge. " Dual Control?"
Group Wall --> Users can private message but do not have individual walls. 
Options to link your Family to other Families. Families can choose what they share on a website.
